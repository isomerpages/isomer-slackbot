## Problem statement
Github does not have a sophisticated user permissions system. This means that for a particular team in a particular Github organization, the team leader cannot add or remove users by themselves; team leaders must contact organization owners, who must then manually add or remove users from teams and/or organizations.

## Mission
This Slack bot is meant to help Github organization owners delegate the responsibility of managing teams and users to team leaders. 

## How it works

## Process

Step 1: The organization owner needs to create a new bot account for his/her organization. Save the personal access token of this bot account.
Step 2: Create a Slack app and save the Slack secret and Slack OAuth Access token.
Step 3: Register slash commands on the Slack app so that the request URLs of your site match with that on app/user.js.
Step 4: Launch the app using Nodemon.
